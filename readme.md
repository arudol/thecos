Welcome to the thermal compton scattering code!

This software is designed to compute the time evolution of photon spectra from a thermal population of leptons. It includes emission/absorption terms thermal bremsstrahlung, cyclotron and double Compton emission, as well as adiabatic cooling effects. Compton scatterings between the thermal population and the photons are included through the Kompaneets equation. 

Requirements: Python 3.x
